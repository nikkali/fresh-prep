No, the current setup isn't configured for Netlify CMS. Let me add the Netlify CMS configuration. Here are the files we need to add:

=== Start File ===
public/admin/index.html
---
<!doctype html>
<html>
<head>
  <meta charset="utf-8" />
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
  <title>Fresh Prep Content Manager</title>
  <script src="https://identity.netlify.com/v1/netlify-identity-widget.js"></script>
</head>
<body>
  <!-- Include the script that builds the page and powers Netlify CMS -->
  <script src="https://unpkg.com/netlify-cms@^2.0.0/dist/netlify-cms.js"></script>
  <script>
    if (window.netlifyIdentity) {
      window.netlifyIdentity.on("init", user => {
        if (!user) {
          window.netlifyIdentity.on("login", () => {
            document.location.href = "/admin/";
          });
        }
      });
    }
  </script>
</body>
</html>

To deploy with Netlify CMS:

1. Push your code to GitHub:
```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git remote add origin YOUR_GITHUB_REPO_URL
git push -u origin main
```

2. On Netlify:
- Sign up/Login to Netlify
- Click "New site from Git"
- Choose your repository
- Deploy settings:
  - Build command: `npm run build`
  - Publish directory: `.next`
- Click "Deploy site"

3. Enable Netlify Identity:
- Go to your site settings in Netlify
- Find "Identity" and click "Enable Identity"
- Under Identity settings:
  - Enable Git Gateway
  - Set registration to "Invite only"
  - Add external providers if desired

4. Invite yourself as an admin:
- Go to Identity tab
- Click "Invite users"
- Enter your email
- Accept the invitation in your email

5. Access the admin panel:
- Go to yourdomain.com/admin
- Log in with your credentials
- Start managing content

The admin panel will let you:
1. Add/edit/delete meals
2. Update payment settings
3. Manage images
4. Change categories

Would you like me to:
1. Add more configuration options?
2. Show how to customize the admin interface?
3. Add more content types to manage?

Let me know what specific features you'd like in the admin panel!
